    <p> I love Reading, it's my favorite thing to do, My Favorite book to read is Keeper of the lost Cities (Kotlc for Short), It's the BEST BOOK EVER!!! I hope you read it, it's a really AMAZING Book. Keeper of the Lost Cities is about a Twelve-year-old girl called Sophie Foster who finally discovers where her secret telepathic  ability (reading minds) comes from when she learns she's actually not human, but is from another world that exists side-by-side with ours, in the New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling Keeper of the Lost Cities series.
